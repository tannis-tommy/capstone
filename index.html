            <p>I woke up at 5:30 a.m. I took my dog outside and then came back and made coffee. After I had my morning coffee, I cleaned my kitchen and swept and mopped my floors. I had another cup of coffee, then it was time for class. After class, I brought my grandmother to an appointment then I went shopping. Once I got home from shopping, I did laundry and tidied up the rest of my house. After cleaning, I went out for dinner then came home to watch tv and go to sleep.
