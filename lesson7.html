            <p>I woke up at 5:30 a.m. I took my dog outside and then came back and made coffee. After I had my morning coffee, I cleaned my kitchen and swept and mopped my floors. I had another cup of coffee, then it was time for class. After class, I brought my grandmother to an appointment then I went shopping. Once I got home from shopping, I did laundry and tidied up the rest of my house. After cleaning, I went out for dinner then came home to watch tv and go to sleep.

        <h3>What made me decide I wanted to learn to develop websites?</h3>
        <p>As part of my work history, I worked as a Communications Coordinator. One of my tasks was to work with a consulting company and a couple of colleagues to develop a website for my organization. I spent many hours writing and editing content for the website but did not have the background for website development or the time to learn. I did learn the basics for updating content based off of layouts created by the consultants but decided I was interested in learning more. The website was for my former office and can be found at
